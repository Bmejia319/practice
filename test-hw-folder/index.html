                            I currently work on the business operations side for a large tech company. But, I'm taking this web development intro course with the hopes of gaining a more technical understanding of my industry.

                            Here's some DJ Khaled Lorem Ipsum: "You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. Hammock talk come soon. Surround yourself with angels. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. They don’t want us to eat. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another one: "To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Hammock talk come soon. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat."
